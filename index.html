<p><font size="3" color="lime">The unimaginable has become a reality.  The 2016 Presidential elections have come and gone, and we are now marching headlong in to a future that 
has Donald J Trump as President of the United States.  If you're looking for someone to blame to don't need to go any further then to look into a mirror.  This is all of our 
faults and we must bare the burdens of responsibility for this crisis.  Is it fair?  Probably not.  But, fairness means little in a situation such as this one.  All we can do 
now is take action to mitigate the damage this man is likely to cause while in Office.</p>
<p> We all know the score. Trump is a liar, period. He is too cocky to actually help America, or the world, in any valuable way. He is not a genius billionaire businessman. 
Facts are he has more failed business ventures than he has successes. He knows nothing of science or mathematics and other scientific advancements.  He is greedy beyond belief, 
he is racist, full blown sexist, misogynistic, and places little value on the advice, sound council, or opinions of any one but himself.  He can barely keep a cool head on 
Twitter, and now, in short time he will have access to all of the resources of the US Federal Government, including the ability to make the ultimate decision about launching a 
nuclear weapon. This can not be allowed to go on unchecked.</p>
<p><b>What is Mogul? Mogul is Donald Trump's code name with the Secret Service. We are Anonymous #OpGov. What are we doing?</b></p>
<p>
1) Brace for hate coming from Trump supporters, and help people counteract it.
2) Make the media our allies, expose dirt that is detrimental to Trump and his supporters (once again, helping those that may be impacted by hate)
3) Bring the message of encryption and safety so that the First Amendment will be held up (since he is likely to use the NSA and FBI against minorities and non WASP types)
4) Push for election reform, make it known that other forms of election exist. Lets push to abolish the electoral college, and convince others that alternative vote is a much 
better system

The Bonus
5) Fuck that fucker up for the lulz!</p>
